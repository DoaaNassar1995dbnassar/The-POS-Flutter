## About ThePOS

An open-source initiative that belongs to [Gaza Tech Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/142204986283498) to encourage the Gazans developer to share their knowledge with each other and contribute to the open-source world.

## Built With 
- Flutter version: [Flutter 2.5.0](https://flutter.dev/)
- Architecture: [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
- State Management: [GetX](https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx)
- Route Management: [GetX](https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx)
- Localization: [GetX](https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx)

We chose Getz as the main State Management for this project so we can balance the experience of the contributors, GetX will be easier for beginners to catch and at the same time, we ensure the separation of the business logic from the presentation correctly and avoid boilerplate code.
